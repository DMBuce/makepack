MAKEPACK README
===============

A minecraft texture pack editor.

Overview
--------
Makepack is a Makefile used to create a slightly tweaked version of the default
minecraft texture pack.

Requirements
------------

Makepack is written and tested using these tools:

* Bash
* GNU CoreUtils
* GNU Make
* ImageMagick
* Zip

Usage
-----

Before using the Makefile, you'll want to edit it and change +PACKNAME+ to
whatever you want your texture pack to be called.

Below is a description of some of the more interesting targets that the makefile
has. This list is not exhaustive.

**all**:
	The default target. Creates the texture pack. Below are the detailed steps
	that the 'all' target performs.
+
* Creates a skeleton +pack/+ directory
* Extracts terrain.png and items.png into the +pack/+ directory
* Copies and pastes files in +pack/terrain.png.d/+ into terrain.png
** Files that are named +NNxMM*.png+ are pasted into row 'NN', column 'MM' of terrain.png
** 'NN' and 'MM' must be two-digit, zero-padded numbers between 01 and 16
* Copies and pastes files in +pack/gui/items.png.d/+ into items.png
** Files that are named +NNxMM*.png+ are pasted into row 'NN', column 'MM' of items.png
** 'NN' and 'MM' must be two-digit, zero-padded numbers between 01 and 16
* Copies +pack/+ into a +PACKNAME+ directory
* Removes extraneous files from +PACKNAME+
* Creates the 'PACKNAME'.zip texture pack file
+
As a result of this process, any texture except for terrain.png and items.png
that is copied into an appropriate subdirectory of +pack/+ will be included in
the final texture pack.

**clean**:
	Removes everything generated by the 'all' target.

**install**:
	Creates 'PACKNAME'.zip if it doesn't exist and copies it to
	+~/.minecraft/texturepacks/+.

**uninstall**:
	Removes +~/.minecraft/texturepacks/'PACKNAME'.zip+.

**example**:
	Creates an +example/+ directory with all texture pack files from
	+minecraft.jar+.

Examples
--------

+pack/terrain.png.d/04x02-gravel.png+:
	When executing `make` or `make all`, this file will replace the texture in
	the 4th column, 2nd row (the position used for the gravel texture) of
	terrain.png.
